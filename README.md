# Injective Explorer

Blockchain and transaction explorer for Tendermint. Supports JSON transactions and UTF-8.
Based on Cosmos Explorer.

## What is different from Cosmos Explorer?

Injective Explorer relies only on REST RPC (no LCD).

Also it has few extra features comparing to Cosmos Explorer.

### List of blocks

### Transaction details

If a block has transactions that are JSON objects, Injective Explorer will render all tx's fields automatically. 
Explorer handles UTF-8 encoded values in a [proper way](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/Base64_encoding_and_decoding).

## Requirements

Injective Explorer is stateless and relies on a high-throughput Tendermint full node to connect to. 
Explorer requires Tendermint RPC endpoints to be available publicly through TLS-secured subdomains. 
The convention is `https://rpc.fullnode.com`.

To change the backend, edit the file `./src/store/modules/blockchain.js`. 
On the lines 5, change the `localhost:26657` part of the URL to your full node's domain name. 

```
rpc: "http://localhost:26657"
```

And change the line `27` too:

```
const client = RpcClient("ws://localhost:26657")
```

**WARNING:** Every user that visits the Explorer opens two websockets to the default full node. 
The user will continue to spam your full node with AJAX requests until they close the page. 
We need a better backend solution for the Explorer! Please help if you can.
## Set Env Variables
Set Correct RPC URL and Network Name in the .env file

```

 VUE_APP_RPC_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:26657
 VUE_APP_NETWORK=Testnet
```
